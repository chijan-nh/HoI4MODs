# Features

* The "preemptive corp" focus no longer occurs a civil war which we against the Emperor. Instead, it takes 210 days for completion; it takes three times as long as the normal NF to democratize through political struggle.

* There are two roots after "showa constitution"; alliance with England (joining the Allies) and making the West Pacific Treaty Organization (own faction). Both root is exciting.
    * In the Allies root, Japan ties intelligence agreement with England and gets other buffs via NFs. Then Japan will fight the Axis with the Allies and Poland. Lastly, Japan and England can make Danubian Confederation in Valkan.
    * In the WPTO root, Japan trys decolonizing Asia and beats fascist Australia and America. As same as rising fascism in France at the Democratic Germany Root, fascists in Australia, New Zealand, and USA get power.
    * Moreover, in the WPTO root, Japan can make Burma, Bangladesh, Pakistan, and India independent from England and invite them to the WPTO faction. 

* Common Korean question and anti-communism NFs, they are based on the Vanilla, are extended and reinforced. 
    * After completion the "preemptive corp" focus, Korean and Manchuria don't become independent. Player can select their destiny. If the "Korean question" is completed and Korean is being annexed by Japan, the stability will decrease. Japan can return Manchuria to China and make alliance with them. On the other hand, since China was dictatorial and corrupt at the time, Japan could also democratize them by force.
    * In the anti-communism root, Japan guarantees and invites Finland to protect from USSR and the third Reich. Japan opens war with Soviet. In this war, Japan can integrate North Sakhalin (Kita Karafuto) and make the Primorsky (Enkaishu) puppet. Lastly, Japan is able to disolve the Soviet Union completely in the peace conference.

* Common economic NFs are added and intense Japanese industry. Besides, beyond difficult condition, Japan can perform the Fugu Plan: Jewish settlement to Manchuria. Then, Japan obtains economic buffs and improve the relationship with USA (if USA is fascist, it will be democratized).
